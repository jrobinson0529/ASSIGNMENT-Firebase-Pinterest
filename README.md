# Binterest

Welcome to my personal version of pinterest! In this exciting new social media app you can create special boards that allow you to save pins to them like recipes, articles, blogs, and whatever else you want. You can keep your interests organized in this easy to use website! You can see other users pins as well and save them to your own boards if you like what they are showing off! You can also click on a users profile image to see all their public pins to snoop around.

### User story

As a user when I initially load the page I will be prompted to login using a google login.

- After I am logged in I can see all public pins from all users that have created them on the site.
- I can click on the profile image in the center of each pin card to see that user's profile.
- I can click "add" and select one of my boards to add a public pin to my boards.
- I can user the search bar to search through all public pins.
- I can click the profile image in the navbar to open a dropdown that allows me to:

  - Create a pin
  - Create a board
  - View my profile
  - Logout

- If I access the view profile page for my profile I will see all boards I have created and can click on individual boards to see the pins stored in that board. I can edit and delete pins. I will also see any pins I saved from the public pins page to each board.
